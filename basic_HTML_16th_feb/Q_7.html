        A Poison Tree (Poem)
    </h1>
<p>
    
    I was angry with my friend;<br>
    I told my wrath, my wrath did end. <br>
    I was angry with my foe: <br>
    I told it not, my wrath did grow.<br>
    <i><br>
        And I watered it in fears,<br>
        Night and morning with my tears;<br>
        And I sunned it with smiles,    <br>
        And with soft deceitful wiles.<br>
    </i><br>
    
    And it grew both day and night,<br>
    Till it bore an apple bright;<br>
    And my foe beheld it shine,<br>
    And he knew that it was mine,<br>
    <br>
    And into my garden stole<br>
    When the night had veiled the pole;<br>
    In the morning glad I see<br>
    My foe outstretched beneath the tree.</p><br><br>
